## Introduction

Balancing such a complex game is a hard task. To tackle such a task I have devised a particularly effective tactic.

**I DONT CARE** about perfect balance and "keeping the game fresh" and having perfectly 50% winrate on every class. The game is going to be broken and unbalanced (from your perspective), this is intended.

There is only 2 edge cases that might cause me to make balance ajustements :
> Is it so broken that everyone is doing it and it's making every other strategy useless ?  
> Is it so boring and uninteractive that it makes playing against unenjoyable ?

### Broken AF

Prob nerfing it tbh.

### Annoying AF

It's slightly more complicated as what can feel boring and uninteractive for one player is often the other player outplaying you every turn. I can't and don't want to balance the fact that your opponent is better than you. It's even more complicated as one big part of the Promised Fantasy:tm: is to slowly track and create a trap for your opponent. Some character will seems uninteractive to newer players because they simply do not know when and how they can interact with them, and will end up losing a game after 15 min of not seeing their opponent then getting backstabbed twice in one turn.

What I want to specificaly avoid is the real "no-counterplay zone". A player able to stay hidden for 60 turns while keeping tabs on their opponent should be rewarded by an opportunity to win the game by killing their opponent. A player knowing their opponent position, intention and actions should be rewarded by an opportunity to deal damage or to set up a trap.
A player running to the edge of the map then not moving for 25 turns shouldn't be rewarded for anything because he didn't take any risks.
