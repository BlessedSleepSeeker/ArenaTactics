## Design Direction

1. A **Team** is a variable amount of character who will lose or win together. Default = 2 teams.
2. The game is won if you are the last standing team OR if you complete your team objective first.
3. Each team can have a variable amount of characters. Default = 1 character per team.

## Characters

Characters are what the player use to interact with the world. As such, ask yourself theses questions to design a new character :

1. What's the general vibe ?
2. How does the character traverse the world ?
3. How does the character interact with the environnement ?
   1. Ignore it, use it, blend into it ?
4. How does the character interact with other characters before full frontal assault ?
   1. On a scale to "invisible" to "I always know where you are"
5. How does the character fight other characters ?
   1. Prefer distance, setup, raw power, contact, traps, poison, slow death, fast explosion ?
